 <p> I am passionate about software development, human-computer interaction, and psychological well-being. 
     I’ve been actively involved in research projects, including trajectories analysing and tapping interaction. 
     I worked as a SQA intern at a semiconductor company in 2019, and my other works focus on web development.

<p>Dancing is a big part of my life - I’ve been dancing Ballet since I was 6, and now exploring traditional chinese dance, modern dance, and ballroom dance. 
    I also love baking, photography, and dreaming. I am an amateur video editor, a language tutor, a certified mental health first aider, and an aspired world traveller.
